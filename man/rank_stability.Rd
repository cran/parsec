\title{
Rank stability analysis in posetic FOD
}
\description{
The function evaluates average ranks and positions in the ranking of the profiles associated to the selected posets generated by different alpha-cuts in the posetic FOD analysis.
}
\usage{
rank_stability(x, ...)
\method{rank_stability}{FODposet}(x,
    selection = 1:length(x$covers),
    coverage_probability = 0.9,
    error = 10^(-5), ...
)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
object of class \code{FODposet} genrated by the function \code{\link{FOD}}.
}
  \item{selection}{
numeric vector or a vector of names to select the cover matrices in the argument \code{x}.
}
  \item{coverage_probability}{
least coverage probability of the rank intervals with extremes \code{lower_ranks} and \code{upper_ranks}.
}
  \item{error}{
the "distance"" from uniformity in the sampling distribution of linear extensions used to evaluate the average ranks. See \code{\link{idn}} for details.
}
  \item{\dots}{
any of above.
}
}
\value{
\item{alpha}{vector of the selected alpha values that generate the different posets from which ranks are generated.}
\item{average_ranks}{data frame of average ranks of the different profiles (by columns) at different alpha values (by rows).}
\item{lower_ranks}{data frame of the lower bounds of the interval for each profile (by columns) at different alpha values (by rows).}
\item{upper_ranks}{data frame of the upper bounds of the interval for each profile (by columns) at different alpha values (by rows).}
\item{ranking}{data frame of positions in the ranking of the profiles (by columns) associated to the selected posets generated by the different alpha values (by rows).}
\item{resolution}{number of elements of the selected posets generated by the different alpha values.}
